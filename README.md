# Microprocessor-Interfacing
Hello and Greetings to all who are visitng this repository, in this repository I will be uploading all the Experiments that are being performed during my 4th Semester in Microproxessor and Interfacing Laboratory(MPI). This Repository is to help the people in refering and understanding the experiements.

List of Experiments:

Experiment 1: 8086 Assembly Language Programme for addition of two 64- bit numbers
Experiment 2: 8086 Assembly Language Programme for multiplication of two 16-bit numbers
Experiment 3: 8086 Assembly Language Programme for division of two 8-bit numbers
Experiment 4: 8086 Assembly Language Programme for generation of Fibonacci Series less than FF
Experiment 5: 8086 Assembly Language Programme for generation of an Arithmetic Progression (AP) Series
Experiment 6: Generate a Geometric Progression (GP) Series.
Experiment 7: Arrange the given numbers of series in order of increasing and decreasing magnitude of numbers.
Experiment 8 : Find the summation as mentioned in the list of experiments already circulated.
Experiment 9: Find the factorial of an 8-bit number
Experiment 10: Find the largest number in a set of 16, 8 bit numbers.
Hope these will help in long run.
